# PyNest - a Python implementation of nested sampling, based on matlab multinest
# originally implemented by Matthew Pitkin et al. This code mostly just ports
# Pitkin's code directly, with a few modifications to the DE code. Right now,
# the multinest based sampling actually is not implemented -- the only choice
# is to evolve the samples in the prior distribution by the use of MCMC, with
# a Student's t distribution and differential-evolution-based proposal
# mechanism.
